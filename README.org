* Quick Intro

This program can be used to see how waves behave in 2D space

+ It simulates waves by solving the differential equation for 2D scalar
  waves
  
+ It can accurately simulate the following
  - Propagation
  - Reflection
  - Refraction
  - Diffraction
  - Interference
  - Total Internal Reflection
    
+ Easy to use: you can paint the sources and obstacles, refractive
  indices of parts of the domain in your favourite image editor
  - For each pixel
  - The red component indicates $\sqrt{1-refractive index}$
  - If the green component is non-zero it indicates a source at that
    point whose frequency is proportional to the magnitude of the
    green component (a value of 12 is recommended for sources)
