#+title: GPU accelerated Wave Simulator
#+author: liquidcat

* Quick Intro

This program can be used to see how waves behave in 2D space

+ It simulates waves by solving the differential equation for 2D scalar
  waves

  \[
  \frac{\partial^2z}{{\partial t}^2} = c^2 \nabla^2 z
  \]
  
+ It can accurately simulate the following
  - Propagation
  - Reflection
  - Refraction
  - Diffraction
  - Interference
  - Total Internal Reflection
    
+ Easy to use: you can paint the sources and obstacles, refractive
  indices of parts of the domain in your favourite image editor
  - For each pixel
  - The red component indicates $\sqrt{1-\mu}$
  - If the green component is non-zero it indicates a source at that
    point whose frequency is proportional to the magnitude of the
    green component (a value of 12 is recommended for sources)

* How to install

1. Clone this git repo

#+begin_src bash
$ git clone https://github.com/MrGizmo123/opengl-wave-simulator
$ cd opengl-wave-simulator
#+end_src

2. Install OpenGL, GLFW and GLEW for your operation system
   - For Arch Linux use
#+begin_src bash
$ sudo pacman -S glfw glew glu
#+end_src

   - For others, the package names should be similar or something like
     ~libglfw~, ~libglew~

3. Compile the program
   
#+begin_src bash
$ make
#+end_src

4. Run!

#+begin_src bash
$ ./a.out
#+end_src

Note: resizing the window breaks the sim (this will be fixed) so do
not resize or tile the window
